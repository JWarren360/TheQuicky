TheQuicky
This is a project for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The finished project is in the root folder. The source files are in the src folder.

The purpose of this site is to help you find a bar close to you that is not very busy but still highly rated on yelp.

TheQuicky uses the Yelp API to retreave the highest rated bars in a ten mile radius of the address entered and displays their location on the "Google Maps" map.

If you go to the list view, you will see a list of the same bars listed in desending order from the least busiest to the most, based on the "hereNow" venue data from the FourSquare API.

Gulp is required to build the source code. After installing Gulp to the root directory, type gulp in the command line to install the gulp plugins and build the source code.
